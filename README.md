Stored Procedures
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed repeatedly with a single command. We create a stored procedure `GetEmployeesByDept` to retrieve employees by department.

A stored function is a reusable block of SQL code that returns a value. We create a stored function `AvgDeptSalary` to calculate the average salary of a department.
